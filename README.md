# SemiConductor-Chip-Analysis

This project explores semiconductor chip data from the CHIP Dataset to analyze trends in CPU and GPU designs, particularly focusing on Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling. The goal is to clean, process, and explore the data to uncover key industry trends and validate important assumptions about chip development.

## Project Overview

In this project, I practiced key data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills using real-world semiconductor chip data. The tasks involved:

1. Handling missing data.
   
2. Dropping irrelevant fields for more efficient analysis.
   
3. Performing EDA to validate assumptions about CPU and GPU performance trends.
   
5. Visualizing correlations between important features like transistor count, die size, and frequency.


## Technologies Used:

1. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   
2. Scikit-learn for Machine Learning models
